This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Firstly, create a local env file `.env.local` by copying the current `.env.example`

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
## Runnign the API
go the the accompanying [API Project](https://github.com/Zamrik1/search-app-api) and run it to be able to fetch the data. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Production mode

To run the application in production mode first build the application using NPM and then run the start command

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

## Future TODO's:

- Replace Classnames and in JS CSS with something nicer like styled-components or using scss
- Add some tests
- create design break points for different layout for different screens
